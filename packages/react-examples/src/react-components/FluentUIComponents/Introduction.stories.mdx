> ### Overview
>
> Fluent UI VNext components and related utilities. This is a result of a dedupe effort for `@fluentui/react` and `@fluentui/react-northstar`.
>
> These components are built as production-ready, generalized, documented, and reusable components to be used in Microsoft products. This enables us and our partners to more easily build great applications without spending a ton of time implementing the same things over and over.
>
> Each component is designed to be RTL-friendly, keyboard accessible, screen reader-friendly, themeable, and generalized. TypeScript definition files are also included, so if you use TypeScript (which isn't a requirement), you will get compiler validation and using an editor like VS Code, you'll get intellisense. Each component is exported as a named module that can be easily imported in your code, allowing your external bundler to create small bundles that include just what you need.
